# ResumeWebsite
ASP.NET Core MVC site for presentation my projects.

For using this project you need to do a few things. 
First, change the database connection string in appsettings.json. 
Second, on the first launch go to /admin and create an admin account. Note, that you can create only one account (just for adding content).

For styling, you can use site.scss file.
Visual design inspired by old school operation system (like dos etc). 
Special thanks to dude, which create a site with old-school pc fonts https://int10h.org/oldschool-pc-fonts/
